;how to hide complexity with lambda functions: 

1. begin by creating a principle function. This is the function that you will be using lambda to hide it's obscurity 


2. Then create a named-lambda-function. This function has two components: 
	(1) Name of the function with one or several parameters 
	(2)The unamed lambda function
		-lambda function contains parameters
		-also contains the principle function, with all of it's parameters. 

3. Now you have to make a decision: 
	A. Do you want lambda to obscure the function entirely, so that no input is required? (IDK why you would want this, might as well write a normal fucking function with values instead of parameters) 
	B. Do you want lambda to have any parameters left for the user to give value to?  

4.	A.  create one variable to take in the param. from the named function, and then create another variable,
	    This time defined by the previous variable, that takes in the rest of the parameters 
	    (those in the unamed lambda function) 
	
	B.Put the values you want to obscure in the named function, and the ones you want the user to give input 
          too in the unamed function. Then create a variable that takes in the parameters from the named function.
